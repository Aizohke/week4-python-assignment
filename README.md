          📘 File Handling & Exception Handling Assignment

📝 Overview

This project demonstrates 'file handling' `"file handling"` and `"exception handling"` in Python.
The program:

* Reads content from a file provided by the user.
* Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist or cannot be read.
* Overwrites the content in the file.
* Writes the modified content into a new file called `output.txt`.
